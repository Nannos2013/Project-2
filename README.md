I used kali linux. It was really intresting getting to know more about linux. It's going to be really important in cyber security and things like penetration testing.

Code Review Joseph Unger
What positive aspects, most of it was not code, and any code there was just mixed in with command line gibberish.
One suggestion of imporvement, learn how to properly code, do not just copy from the command line and call
it code, what I wrote is code, you just coppied what the instructions said and called that code. I am being 
blunt because that is the truth. You gotta read bro.
